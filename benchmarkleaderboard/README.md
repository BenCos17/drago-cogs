I've created a comprehensive Benchmark Leaderboard cog for Red Discord Bot with the following features:

[p]benchmark add "type" "score": Add a benchmark score

Tracks highest score per user per benchmark type
Prevents lower scores from overwriting higher scores


[p]benchmark view "type": View the top 10 scores for a specific benchmark

Displays an embed with ranked scores
Shows user names and their benchmark results


[p]benchmark types: List all existing benchmark types
[p]benchmark delete: Admin command to:

Delete a specific user's score
Delete an entire benchmark type
